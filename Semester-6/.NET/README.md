## Database setup

Labs that use SQL Server (`ROJAL\\SQLEXPRESS`) create their database as follows:

| Lab | Database | How it is created |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Lab7.1 | `Company` | Run `SQLSetup.sql` in SSMS (see `Lab7\Lab7.1\README.md`) |
| Lab7.2 | `EmployeeDB` | Run `SQLSetup.sql` in SSMS (see `Lab7\Lab7.2\README.md`) |
| Lab8.1 | `StudentDB` | EF Core `EnsureCreated()` on first run (see `Lab8\Lab8.1\README.md`) |
| Lab8.2 | `SchoolDB` | EF Core `EnsureCreated()` on first run |
| Lab10 | `IdentityUserDB` | EF Core migration: `dotnet ef database update` (see `Lab10\README.md`) |
